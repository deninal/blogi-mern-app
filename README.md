https://blogi-mern-app.herokuapp.com/

### Blogi is a MERN blogging application with user authentication.

### In order to write a new blog post, the user has to create and account and login

### The front-end of the app is build using React, React Router, Tailwind.css and some Framer Motion animations.

### The backend is written in express, and it has been deployed using Heroku's free tier and the Mongodb Atlas's cloud service is used for the database service.

### Axios is used to interface with the API, and React context for state management.

### Additionally it uses CKEditor as a rich text editor for writting posts which support some basic features like bold, italic, hyperlinks, blockquotes or undo/redo changes.

### While the design is pretty responsive, many elements need further improvements in the next version.
